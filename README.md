# Plant Disease Recognizer

In this project I will be training a Convolutional neural network to classify leaf images into three categories: Healthy, Powdery, Rusty.

## Features
- Plant leaf disease dataset loading (Kaggle)
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model training for multi-class classification
- Model saving and evaluation
- Disease prediction on new leaf images

## Run Training
python src/train.py

## Run Prediction
python src/predict.py

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
